# Introduction
Mejbaan is a project developed for the hackathon with a mission to address the critical issue of food wastage and hunger in the world. More than one-third of all food produced is wasted, while millions of people suffer from hunger and malnutrition every day. This web app aims to bridge this gap by creating a platform where individuals can share their surplus food items, and NGOs or volunteers can collect and distribute the food to those in need.
